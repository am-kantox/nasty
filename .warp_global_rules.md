# Global Warp Rules

This file documents coding style rules that should be applied across all projects.

**Note:** To make these rules apply globally in Warp, you should add them to your personal Warp rules (not project-specific). This file is for reference only.

## Rules to Add Globally

### Rule 1: No Emojis in Documentation

**Content:**
```
Never use emojis in documentation, code comments, commit messages, README files, or any technical writing. Keep all documentation professional and text-based only.
```

**Rationale:** Maintains professional, accessible documentation that works well in all contexts (terminals, screen readers, plain text viewers).

### Rule 2: Pattern Matching Over length/1 in Tests

**Content:**
```
In tests, when checking the number of items in short lists, prefer pattern matching over using length/1:

Good examples:
- assert [_, _, _] = list
- assert match?([_, _, _], list)
- assert [first, second | _rest] = list

Avoid:
- assert length(list) == 3
- refute Enum.empty?(list)

This applies to lists with known small sizes (typically <= 5 elements). For larger or dynamic sizes, length/1 is acceptable.
```

**Rationale:** 
- Pattern matching is more idiomatic in Elixir
- Fails faster with clearer error messages
- Makes the expected structure explicit
- More efficient (no function call overhead)

## How to Apply These Rules

These rules are already added to this project's `WARP.md` file. 

To apply them globally across all your projects, add them to your Warp personal rules through the Warp interface or configuration files.
