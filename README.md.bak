# Nasty - Natural Abstract Syntax Treey

**A language-agnostic NLP library for Elixir that treats natural language with the same rigor as programming languages.**

Nasty provides a proper grammatical Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) for natural languages, enabling:

- **Grammar-First Parsing**: Formal linguistic structure representation using NimbleParsec combinators
- **Multi-Language Support**: Language-agnostic architecture using `@behaviour` (English first, Spanish/Catalan planned)
- **Bidirectional Code Interoperability**: Natural Language ↔ Programming Language AST conversion
- **NLP Operations**: Text summarization, question answering, classification, information extraction
- **Parser Combinators**: Efficient, composable grammar rules with NimbleParsec

## Vision

Treat natural languages with the same rigor as programming languages. Just as Elixir has `Macro.t()` for code AST, Nasty provides a comprehensive AST for English (and future languages), enabling:

1. Parse natural language text into a structured, queryable AST
2. Transform and analyze text through AST operations
3. Convert between natural language and code bidirectionally
4. Build NLP applications (summarization, QA, classification) on a solid foundation
5. Support multiple natural languages through a common abstraction

## Status

🚧 **Early Development** - Implementation planning phase. See [PLAN.md](PLAN.md) for detailed roadmap.

## Quick Example (Planned API)

```elixir
# Parse English text to AST
text = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
{:ok, ast} = Nasty.parse(text, language: :en)

# Query the AST
subject = Nasty.Query.find_subject(ast)
# => %Nasty.AST.NounPhrase{head: %Token{text: "fox", ...}, ...}

# Convert natural language to code
{:ok, code_ast} = Nasty.to_code("Sort the list", source_language: :en, target_language: :elixir)
Macro.to_string(code_ast)
# => "Enum.sort(list)"

# Summarize text
summary = Nasty.summarize(long_text, language: :en, method: :extractive, sentences: 3)
```

## Architecture

Nasty uses a layered architecture:

1. **Language Abstraction Layer**: `@behaviour` for language implementations
2. **Universal AST Schema**: Common structure for all languages
3. **Language Implementations**: English (first), Spanish/Catalan (planned)
4. **NLP Operations**: Built on top of AST transformations
5. **Code Interoperability**: Bidirectional NL ↔ Code conversion

See [PLAN.md](PLAN.md) for complete implementation details.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `nasty` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:nasty, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```
